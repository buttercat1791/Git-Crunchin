 So now I just have a huge deep desire to go watch Bernadas with Barbara Walters. I get it. Well, under the crunch episode 48, it's your boy Ethan, aka. April Possil and I'm Patrick at Catholic Pat. Welcome to the back to school extravaganza. Yes. Woo. Oh, take two because last last try was just too depressing. We didn't. We're not depressed. It's an extravaganza. We're excited because we're extravagant. It's an extravaganza episode. It's a themed episode. The theme is extravagance. Speaking of overdoing it. Oh, here we go. How many people I know? Which is you think you can eat at one saying because I guarantee you it's not more than three. Why did you get three Chick-fil-A sandwiches? I. I found. Okay. So I'm at school a little bit early. You've taken away all of my zest for this episode. I'm at school a little bit early and I'm in the dorm alone. It's just me and my R.D. And we found of one of those Visa gift cards in the laundry room. It was behind a washing machine. And we looked up how much it was and it was $25. Whoa. And it was around dinner time. We were both hungry. Right. And so we were like, what are we going to do? What are we going to eat? Is there anything extravagant we could do with this money? We're going to get extravagantly. I don't know what we're going to eat. But I know how we're going to eat. Like kings. Yes. And so we drove out to this place called Robinson, Pennsylvania, which for those of you who don't know, which is most of you, that is 40 minutes away from Steubenville. And it is the nearest Chick-fil-A. So we walked into the nearest Chick-fil-A to Steubenville, which is 40 minutes away. And we said, all right, look Mark, the guy's name is Mark. Look Mark, I've recently come into some money and I need to know how much. I had a windfall. I've received some inheritance money. I told my father that I wanted him dead and that I wanted all of my inheritance money. And I've come here to squander it. Give me your finest hoors and prostitutes, Mr. Mark, because I am the prodigal son here to steal your sandwiches and your women. Is that how it went down? No, in fact. Okay. I made money the old fashioned way. I've got to remember my next day. So like, all right, how many Chick-fil-A sandwiches will $25 buy us? And if you're wondering, that's six. So we got three each and at like sandwich number two, I was feeling it. I was like, look. I was feeling it. I was at the point of hilarity. And I was like, I can make it through this one. But I need to start the next one immediately before I feel the second one hit bottom of my stomach. Like I have to make sure the other one's sliding in right behind him. So my stomach doesn't know what's coming. What? It was a sinful amount of calories that I consumed. I looked up how much a Chick-fil-A sandwich is without sauce. It's like 1,000 calories. So much. So. So you had 3,000 calories in the span of like 30 minutes. Yes. In 30 minutes, you ate more calories than the average European peasant in the 1500s in their entire lifetime. What? Peasants. Peasants. Are they still called? Are they peasants anymore in Europe? No. I said in the 1500s, they were peasants back then. They're peasants now too. They're just richer and they eat more calories. So I spent all day in penance for the gross sin against my own body that I committed yesterday. What did you do today? Well, not that, first of all. We're so good at segues. This episode is great. Yeah. You know what? I would call our segues extravagant. Extravagan segues. Boom. Okay. So today I went to so my cousin is entering a religious community called the Little Sisters of the Lamb. She has been living with them for the past year-ish, year and a half-ish. She hasn't entered postulancy yet, but she just finished up like one of the steps in the process. So she was home for two weeks. So I picked her up, drove her to the monastery and hung out with the Little Sisters and the Little Brothers in Kansas City, Kansas. So it was really cool. I got to do not gluttony, which was nice. It was a lot of fun to hang out with the sisters and talk to the brothers. So if you are a praying type of person, please pray for my cousin and please pray for that community. So that's the shout out. Say tuned. Yeah. Yeah. I figured that none of them listen because they don't have phones or the internet at their house or at their monastery. So this is not me doing fan service. This is me genuinely plugging religious brothers and sisters because they're really cool and a lot of fun to hang out with. So that's what I did today. And then I came home and then I played my Nintendo DS and then I ate a cheeseburger and then I watched Teen Titans Go. Back up, back up, back up. I watched Teen Titans Trouble in Tokyo, which is a great feature film based on the hit animated television show Teen Titans. Anyway, and then I drank a Sprite and now I'm here. Shout out Vince Staples. So what's good in the hood, Pat Money? Nothing much. I mean, you already heard my story. Sweet. That was all I got. Nice. So what you're saying is... You've heard it twice now. What you're saying is we can turn this podcast from an extravagant intro to an extravagant topic. Yes. Transition. But in some sick transition music. Here. Yeah, I didn't know that worked that way. You learn something new every day. Speaking of learning, it's almost back to school. You are right. You are right, Patrick. Are you excited for your senior year? Nope. Gosh, dang it. We rehearsed this. Yes, Ethan. Yes, you are excited. I'm really not excited for my senior year for a variety of reasons. Why are you pooping on this extravagant extravaganza? So my senior year should be extravagant, but it's not going to be because I have to one, take classes and two, worry about getting a job and three, run a podcast and four, continue to be single. Oh, yeah, we were at the same route. Find a wife. Yeah, that's, that's on the list of today's. No, our podcast is still new and fresh. Our first episode was about, oh, I don't have a wife. It's almost been a year and we're still, we're still using that. Oh, those of you that have been with us since the beginning, hello, hello, please be my wife. Never mind. In the war of attrition of us getting women, we have lost. We have worse off than we were a year ago. That's, that's, that's. I'm just a limiting how sad our lives are. Oh, it's Saturday night. It's Saturday night. I'm shirtless. I'm talking in a microphone to a guy I've met one time and I've had one sprite. I keep burping. I keep tooting. I can't control my body and the noises that it makes and the sounds that it does because all I have in life is this podcast. And all I want to do is make a nice, extravagant back to school episode. But no, we have to bring up the fact that one, I don't have a wife. Two, when I did have a wife, she left. And three, my dog keeps licking my shorts. I don't even have a dog. I'm done. I'm out. Just the most fulfilling birthday hats and just sad. Sad confetti. This whole episode is going to be sad confetti. All right. Just gray, white and black. Patrick, I need you to focus on the extravagance. We're so focused. We're so, I'm laser zoned in on this right now. It's back to school time. It is back to school time. What is your favorite like back to school prep? Like, what do you do? Do you have like a ritual every year that like, what do you do to prepare for school? It's actually pretty sick ritual. So what I do is I finish my internship and I get really hyped because I don't have to be an intern anymore and I get to be a student again. And I tell my mom, hey, mom, you know how you financially support me? And she's like, yeah. And then I say, what if we went to the store and me and my mom and we go and we hang out like one day before I leave and me and my mom just chill all day and we like go get like the stupid crap that I need for school like dryer sheets and you know, like if I needed another pair of pants or something like we go and we get that and we just spend all day together just kind of picking up odds and ends for things that I need to go get. And it's a really fun day. Like it's the kind of the transition point for me. It's like, okay, when I get to do my shopping day with my mom and like she helps me get everything that I need and helps me pack up and all that stuff that I know it's about times like get back into the swing of things. And so that's kind of my practically that's one of my biggest things. It's not really of any help with regards to school, but that is like what we do here in the Stevie household, I guess. What about you? I have no rituals because I've come to school a different way each year. First year I flew. Second year I drove. Drove a completely different car. So my life is different every year. Nice. It's new every season. That's true. My actual ritual for coming back to school is convincing myself that I'm going to be organized and keep a planner and then doing it for two weeks and then never looking at it ever again. I'm actually really good at keeping planners. I am so bad at it. Like like astonishingly bad. For someone who's a P and not a J on the astrology scale that is Myers Brooks. Yeah. I'm very good at keeping a planner. I just understand the fact that I'm not going to use it all the time and then I only use it when I feel like I need to. Yeah. I feel like some people like their planner as their phone, you know, every time someone tells them like, Hey, at three o'clock there's going to be, I don't know, a plane is going to go overhead and they're like, Oh, I got to write that out. But we're like, we're like, Oh, it's three o'clock is an hour. I'm just going to keep looking at my watch or my phone. I don't have a watch until it gets to three o'clock and then I'm going to look up and I'm going to see the plane. Did I say bird or plane? You said plane. Okay. Superman. Yeah, what I do would probably freak out like 70% of people because I go to class and I say, okay, homework is due on Thursday and then I keep it in my head and then I go to a next class and I say, all right, project is due in two weeks on Friday. Okay. And I keep it in my head. And then I go to the, I do the podcast. I say, all right, got to record and edit and I keep that in my head. And then I do that. I literally for everything and I don't, I write nothing down. It even is more punctual than I am. Most of the time it usually works out. And when it doesn't work out, it's disastrous. But that's only like one out of every 100 times that I have to deal with the consequences of my ineptitude. Let's give some actual practical like spiritual tips about school. What do you think? Not even school, maybe school. I don't know. I feel bad because we're talking about school and like some people listen, don't even go to school. So let's find some tips, let's find some tips and tricks, some advice points, some extravagant pieces of words that will apply not only, not only to students returning to school, but to people transitioning into the workforce and moving out of the summer season into the fall. What do you think? All right. All right. Let's, let's keep, let's keep our appeal wide and cast those nets, baby. Let's cast those nets and reel them in. Boom. We ain't got no target audience on the crunch. Got no money in my pocket. You folks are not being marketed to. I got a hole in my jeans. Okay. What where? Go ahead. Hey, you go first and then I'll think while you talk. Okay. Tips for getting back to school. All right. So it's actually like easier to get into habits in a new place. That's what my mom told me. She was like Patrick. A floss. And so here's what you need to do. When you get, when you get to school for the first time, you're going to need to get into a routine where you floss and since you're going to be in a new place every time it's night time at that place, you're going to be like, I need a floss. And here we are. I floss now. It worked. Thanks, mom. Nice. And so I think maybe the same thing works with prayer life. You know, you're in a new place. If you're, if you switch dorms, you're living in a new house, you know, like when you move in, you move your stuff in, don't just plop everything willy nilly. You know, maybe save a corner and put like a little, little bookshelf there with your Bible, prayer journal, some spiritual books, like the many that we have recommended here on the crunch. Yes. And make that your little prayer corner, put a special chair there, you know, like make that your area or find like a place on campus that's quiet at seven or eight in the morning and wake up, maybe wake up an hour before class and get out there because that hour, actually, this is a completely new tip, period, new tip. It's been a lot earlier because sleep is dumb. Right? We talked about this. We did. A couple of weeks ago. I actually get just get enough sleep. That's actually good. Yeah. Go to bed. Go to bed earlier. So you don't need reasonable time. Yeah. My freshman, my freshman fall, I had no classes until 1230 and I still kept a 10 to seven sleep schedule and it was the best semester of my life. Nice. I'm impressed. It was awesome. I, it was awesome. I slept through a mom if you're listening. I'm sorry. One time I slept through an 1130 class. Wow. To be fair, to be fair, I had stayed up until four o'clock the night before working on stuff, but still that was a hard one to swallow. Wake up. Oh man, it's noon. Is this what rock bottom feels like? Yeah, it is. Here's a tip. This isn't a tip as much as it is an admonishment. Oh, guys. Here we go. Extravagant admonishment. Let's say, so here we go. So I have some engineering friends, right? We take some difficult classes together. Sometimes my engineering friends will not have the time to complete their assignment. And so they'll go on this little website called check.com and they will copy down their assignment and turn it in instead of just doing the work themselves. And it's really easy to submit to this. It's basically the same as taking your friend's homework, putting down the work, turning it in and just saying that you worked on it together or whatever. It's a huge temptation, especially in engineering because it's just math. Like you can't. It's really easy to plagiarize because there's one. There's no intellectual property in math. Exactly. You can just take it and you can just do it. I know this is a struggle for high schoolers as well because they have math worksheets and science worksheets that you can easily look up the answers to or just copy up for friend or whatever. And that is sinful and it's so easy to justify. It seems so small. Like, oh, I just didn't have time to finish it. I just copied down, turned it in, no problem. It's so easy to justify that because that's a lie that is dishonest. But it's true, maybe you didn't have time to finish it and also maybe that means that you should not get a good grade. Yeah. Like, people, here's what makes me so upset is that people, instead of taking the time to do the work and getting off their phone, getting off social media, getting off Reddit, getting off YouTube and actually putting their time into the work instead of distractively doing one problem every 20 minutes, they'll just sit there and complain about how the school system is rigged and how it's out to get them and there's so much work and it's so different than the way it was before and they just expect us to do all these things. It's like, if you spent less time tweeting about how much homework you have, you'd be done with your homework. You know, I'm talking to myself right now. That's what I do on this podcast. You're Reddit and YouTube and those are like your holy trinity of time wasting apps. Yeah, exactly. But do you like, you know what I mean though, people will just spend all this time just whining and complaining about like, oh my goodness, like college sucks. You know, I can't believe they expect us to do all these things. Like professor blah, blah, blah is so unfair and we spend too much money to have to do this and this is even going to matter when I graduate. Like, I've heard all of it. I've heard all of it. I've said all of it, you know, none of it justifies sinning and being dishonest, which is like a hard pill for people to swallow. He's like, I don't care. You're a sinner. Go to confession. But I don't care. So that's my biggest tip. That's my biggest tip for going back to school is stop cheating on your assignments. Stop slouching off on your projects. Like this, this is me to a T like I do this. You know, I struggle with it just the same as everybody else does. Stop doing it because it's one sinful to it's not good for your education. You aren't learning anything. And three, just do the right thing, you know, I don't know. That's my that frustrates me. I have I have better. Yeah, because like everyone expects us to give prayer tips. Now that's that's classic crunch. We're going to do some new extravagant crunch. Extravagant crunch tips. Life tips. Life tips. Here we go. Life tips portion. You got I got I got I got an I got an admonishment to myself. Oh, I'm ready. A reflective admonishment. And you kind of you kind of touched on it. Do you look at my tweets during the semester and my class schedule? They usually overlap. Oh boy. That works. Yeah, or they're like past that's a whole nother thing. Catholic Twitter after dark. Yeah, I would say that tweeting during class is also a sin. Or at least it shows a sin for disorder of desire, which is weirdly a sin. My best tweets happen during class. I mean, you can write them down. No, no, like tweet during class. That's not as good. I write I write tweets down during mass sometimes. Oh, Patrick, we need to have a conversation. Hold on. Hold on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's not like that. It's like this. I have a pen. I have paper. I'm thinking about this tweet. I'm just going to write it down and get right back to the homily. It's classic distraction management. Anyway, so. But Twitter, you open your phone and it's full of distractions. It's not distraction management. It's distraction encouragement. So you're sitting you're sitting in class that you have not paid for. Usually being so like if anybody ever has given you any money for not paying for schools, someone's paying you to be there, you're on your phone. Time during work is obviously immoral because your time's dealing, right? So it's obviously the same during class. But that you're all you're being rude to a professor whose job it is to be there and like to teach you. And so it's like it's rude to tweet during class and being rude is a sin. I know. I know how. Yeah, being rude is a sin at never mind. Being rude is a sin at me being rude is a sin. I don't know what I I had a professor. I had a theology professor who was is a doctors, France, he might listen to the podcast. And this is my second semester and he said no laptops in class. Everyone was like, I'm sorry. What is this? The dark ages? Why are you not allowed to have a lap up to me? Like, look, you can write stuff down. You can do it. But I was in grad school like two years ago. I know what it's like to sit in the back up at theology class and play sieve for and still pass because I don't want to read. Oh, that's a that's the life right there. Can I can I have that man's life? How much I would give to just sit in a class and play sieve all day. Oh, but that's the thing. It's like you can play you can play sieve for whenever you want. No, I can't Patrick. Just don't be in college. Just don't be in college. I have to say if you if you want to do why are why are you paying $400 a credit hour or whatever God awful number it is to sit in a room not and I'm going to talk and play under phone. It's such it's such it comes down to like such an entitlement and such a pride. I think that exists among our generation is that like we are entitled to be entertained right and when class gets boring then we we demand entertainment we demand to be to be to be occupied with something, you know, like we we don't have the ability. We don't have the ability to humble ourselves to say, you know, something that might not be immediately gratifying is good for me. And that just eats away at our attention span and he eats away at our work ethic and eats away at everything that's good that needs to be built Morty. And there's and that has ramifications down the line has ramifications at work and in your personal life and in your relationships and in your marriages and in your prayer life and everything that you want to do because we can't even sit still and pay attention to a topic that could be potentially interesting and help you in your life because the professor is taking is taking five minutes to explain something that you already understand. And so you look at your phone for 10 minutes and he's moved on to something else that you don't understand and then you miss that and then and then you bail on the rest of the class mentally because you missed what he was saying for five minutes. You know, like that's that's the epitome of of millennial pride in my opinion. And it's and it sucks because everybody in that classroom that graduates and passes can end up with the same degree, right? And you can like no matter who put in the work. And so if you if you sit in your in your desk and play said for and I feel really bad because Dr. Swansky listens then he's like, well, hey, I respect it full respect to Dr. Francis Swansky man, Franzke. Franzke. Like if you if you if you play simph for during your doctoral seminar, whatever doctorate students do, I don't know, and you get a doctorate. It's like, Oh, cool. I have this doctorate or I have this bachelor's degree or whatever. And it's it's the same one that guy has, but he earned it. And so me having this bachelor's degree and knowing less than him does dishonor to the degree itself. And so when the people that that sit and complain about a system that doesn't work and then they don't work in the system, they're the reason why the system doesn't work. So you have two options. You can go to school and slack off and not complain about the system or you can put 100 percent into the system and then complain when the system is a work. Those are your two off. Yeah. People pick option one almost 99% of the time. Yeah. Which is unfortunate because like we live, we live in a great time where we have the opportunity to go and learn, you know, or or even better, like if you have a job, you're given the opportunity to go and work. There are millions of people that don't have that opportunity. There are millions of people that don't get to learn or work or have have the even just the chance to do something like that and we're just going to waste it on our phones. Maybe just maybe it is our actions in school that are the extravagance. Wow. GK Chesterton just hopped on the podcast, ladies and gentlemen. Extremely Chesterton boys. Yeah. I mean, as far as extravagant tips go, I mean, that's kind of the biggest ones is like actually work actually do what you're supposed to do. You pray, go to confession when you mess up. Don't allow the little small habitual sins to like permeate through your life, like copying down an assignment or not paying attention during class or sleeping in 10 minutes late every single day or whatever it is. Those are the small things that can make a school you're really great or really terrible and gossiping about your professors gossiping about your professors. Yeah. Anyway, like we take those we take the big things we go, oh, my thermoclass is really ruining my semester. Is your thermoclass ruining your semester or is the fact that you can't seem to pay attention for longer than five minutes ruining your semester? I don't know. Yeah. Let me just yeah, we need to we need to grow discipline. The only way to do that is by just doing small things every day. Like the heroic minute is, you know, getting up out of bed as soon as your alarm clock goes off or whatever, whatever that may be that you need to grow and discipline and start that now and then just do it. I don't have any other way to say it. Spiritually go to daily mass, go to confession, form a community. Don't be scared of the Catholic community on campus or at your parish during the school year. Like if you're in high school and you're not going to youth group during the year, what are you doing? Get your life together. That community needs you. You are a valued member of that community, whether you know it or not, go participate. And if the community sucks and you're better than the community, go to the community and make it better. We talked about this. We have talked about this. Prayer and community go hand in hand. If you're praying on your own, but you don't have community, you're failing. If you have community, but you don't have prayer, then you're failing. Those two are so important, especially in an academic environment to help, you know, keep going and keep making your life good and holy. Yeah. What do you got, Pat? I'm running low on tips and tricks, extravagant tips and tricks. Tips and tricks. I have no more profound slash preachy, preachy, LLL tips and tricks. But do you have any like fun tips like any classic freshman advice? Yeah, yeah. Some first time college freshman dorm advice. Oh boy. Let's do this. Oh, man. First of all, everyone wants to hear your music. Play it as loud as you want. Oh, I actually did that. I was that guy. Let me think here. Come out of the shower with your iPod screaming. Anyway, where where shower shoes? Where showers? Where shower shoes. Let's see here. Make sure that if you live in a dorm with like both men and women, spend as much time as possible on the women's side of the dorm. Orientation weekend is when you find your wife. Choose wisely. Yeah. That's the rule. Make sure that you wear clothes that you would never wear at home. Reinvent yourself. Reinvent yourself. Like, this is on here we go. Honest tip. College is a good time to transition. It's like if you were a nerd in high school, you could be a jock now. If you were a jock in high school, looks like you got to be a nerd. Sorry. It's just the way that works. Everybody changes in college. If you are a band geek in high school, you have a unique opportunity to become emo. Like, only traditional roles from 80s high school movies are you allowed to don? You cannot be able to do it. If you are if you are a trad in high school, maybe not the time to become charismatic. I don't know. Maybe now is the time. Maybe think about it. I don't know. Yeah. Wear pants. Don't wear pants. What? I'm just going back and forth. I'm just trying to give a little give and go, a little extravagant, you know, baboon, bada bane. Freshman, if you book college credits in high school, everyone wants to hear about how you're technically a sophomore. Tell everyone how you're a freshman. Also your ACT score or your SAT scores. Everybody's got to know about those. Admissions are not the only people that want to hear about that. Everybody wants to know if you've got an A on the test without studying, make sure you bring that up. If you didn't do any of the work on the group project, we still got an A. Tell all your friends. Tell all your friends. I'll actually do that because then they'll know who to avoid next time. If you totally got wasted the night before, make sure that you cannot stop talking about it. Like literally non-stop. Like you will be the, oh gosh, I'm thinking of all the cool people I know. All of them were drunk. All of them talk about alcohol. Like alcohol all the time. Try to get some of that fat cushion. Make sure you, I want to smell it off of you. Like I just want to whiff it as you're coming down the hallway. And make sure when you join a fraternity, make sure they're on the Dean's bad side. Recreat Animal House. Recreat Animal House. Girls, when you join a sorority, completely abandon your faith. Go all in on your sisterhood. Don't even think about coming back to church. Chapter is your new church. Fraternity men. Same deal. Forget about, forget about, Catholics and albs. You're going sparies and chubbies. Rest of your life. You can't go back. Once you go frat, you never go back. Honestly. Even you dropped your frat lashes and that's a shout out. Don't, we're doing a bit. We can't, you can't do that. Tada, shut up, we're doing a bit. Okay, shut up, we're doing a bit. Get as involved as possible on campus. Neglect your classes. Do it for the sake of your resume. Nobody asked about your macro class on your resume, but they do know that you are in the veterans for Iranian freedom group on campus. So that's good. The campus political groups are the coolest clubs on campus. Join all of them. Even the opposing ones. When somebody is protesting on campus, make sure you go up and engage in rational dialogue with them. They're super looking for that. This is topical. We got to get out of here. No, that was actually, that happens. Sorry, I'm just, I'm putting out all of my frustrations with K-State. On this podcast. It's sliding. It's sliding. Same from the slide. And finally, you can be as active as possible on the campus Facebook page. Ask all of your questions. It's essentially Google. All right, that's all the tip. Those are all the tips. Those are all the tips. Thank you, thank you for participating in the trip trip, in the freshman tips, extravaganza portion of the podcast. As you can tell, we didn't have any real content this week. We just wanted to be a little extravagant, wouldn't we? We just wanted to be extravagant, honestly. Here's a fun thing. This is good. For the people that have made it this far, we've got a treat for you. So next week, our interview with my good friend Mikey Needleman is coming out and he has graciously agreed to give away a copy of his CD for Frizzle through the crunch. All you've got to do to enter is a couple things. One tweet, your favorite quote from this week's episode with hashtag the crunch on Twitter and we will take note of all of the tweets with hashtag the crunch. Not even a quote, just any tweet about the crunch with that hashtag and we will take all of those into account throughout the week and we will mix them up. If you, another option is, if you do that, you'll get into the drawing. If you leave a review on iTunes, you will be entered into the drawing. So make sure you put your name on your iTunes review. Or we'll just say it out and you can DM us if that's you. Be honest. Leave a review on iTunes or we will make a post on Facebook and if you share that post, you will be entered into the drawing. So those are the three ways. So using hashtag the crunch, leaving an iTunes review and or sharing our post on Facebook. You can do one of those three. You can do all of those three. If you do all of those three, you get entered three times to win the CD. So the more you do, the more likely you are to win the great Mikey Needleman CD. He's a phenomenal musician and you'll really enjoy what he has to say next week. So just a little, just a little bonus preview for you there. I might add in some of Mikey's music at the end just to give you a little incentive. I listened to Healing in the Waters a couple of days ago and it was a bop. I was so into it. It was anyway. It was so good. So that's our news. Patrick, you got any other news? Yeah. The orders for the t-shirts went in. It is out of our hands. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen. We did it. It only took us three months, but we did it. I made this so much more complicated than it needed to be in the future and I already talked to people and this is already set up. They have a storefront set up with this local business in Werton, West Virginia, so like there. You would go to our website. This is how it's going to be in the future. You will go to our website. You will click a link and you'll go to their website, which has a store and you select your item, select the size, put all your payment information and shipping information on their website. It goes right to them. They collect all the orders, ship them out all in one day and they send us a check. Literally, we do nothing, which means we will not mess anything up, which is inevitable when we try to do things. All right. So there's going to be so many crunch things in the future. We're going to make t-shirts and we're going to make catching foxes pay for them. That's right. Oh dear. Shout out. That's good. Patrick, do you have anything else to tell the people while I pull up Crunch of the Week? Oh, oh, dang it Ethan. Maybe about our Patreon page? Our Patreon page. So we're revamping and by the time, oh wait, this episode's coming out tomorrow. So by the time this episode comes out, nothing will have happened. So our Patreon page is currently revamping. We're working on some changes. So the first thing that I want to do, and I can actually do this tonight or tomorrow, so this is going to happen, we're going to make a Patreon Facebook group. So we're all in one little fun little group and we can all talk to each other. Because Patreon has its own built in social networking sort of thing, but it's not as fun because nobody has the Patreon app except for us. So we're going to put you all in a Facebook group and then we're going to give the individual patrons some special information, sneak peeks. We're going to do like one on one. We're schedule one on one video chats and stuff like that to really. I'll probably post more on Facebook in that chat than I actually do on my real Facebook page. They're in that like group. It's going to be so much fun. Because it'll be a ton of fun. We'll get to interact. It's going to be a group. It'll be a group. Yeah, we'll just get to interact with you guys and like talk about whatever you guys want to talk about. It'll be if you guys want to have episode discussions or anything for other people that love the crunch as much as you do, that will be the place to go. So any donation, any dollar amount to the crunch Patreon, which is patreon.com slash the crunch, will get great access to this new fancy dangled Facebook group. Facebook. Yeah, it's going to be awesome. Sweet. Close group. Close group. You can't find it if you search for it because we're going to name it something secret like the super secret hidden extravagant crunch Facebook patreon group.com slash gov. Flash created dots. You don't get that joke. You don't want to be off this. Never mind. Go on. I don't know anything. Crunch of the week. You do. Two stars, by the way. Only here for Patrick. Hopefully my listening released a few souls from purgatory 10 out of 10 would recommend listening as a spiritual work of mercy. Thank you, trolling. How about you? We got recommended. If you're listening, you get some souls out of purgatory because we're that bad. I Hey, what are you talking? We, um, this balances out because I got a curious cat message. The first week curious cat was out that was T B H I skip over your podcast. Probably the same, probably the same person. Probably the same person, but totally fine, by the way, because you still listen to the podcasts. Not like you're only half listening to the podcast in terms of numbers. So you're just, you're just being mean online. And that's the same. It's a sin being rude is a sin. Um, man, I think that was good. That was fun. Uh, hopefully we'll provide some good tips. Hopefully you, uh, we might have done nothing at all. I don't know. Hopefully our bit didn't go on too long. It did, but it was worth it. It was too too extravagant. Hey, hey, look at what we did. Extravaganza. Uh, alright. Alright, I'm closing it out. Thank you all for listening. It was good. Thank you all for listening. Please pray for us. We'll be praying for you and we will see you on the Twitter. Bye bye.
